# Money Open Exchange Rates

A gem that calculates the exchange rate using published rates from
[open-exchange-rates](https://openexchangerates.org/)

## Usage

~~~ ruby
require 'money/bank/open_exchange_rates_bank'
moe = Money::Bank::OpenExchangeRatesBank.new
moe.cache = 'path/to/file/cache'
moe.app_id = 'your app id from https://openexchangerates.org/signup'
moe.update_rates

# (optional)
# set the seconds after than the current rates are automatically expired
# by default, they never expire, in this example 1 day.
moe.ttl_in_seconds = 86400
# (optional)
# use https to fetch rates from Open Exchange Rates
# disabled by default to support free-tier users
# see https://openexchangerates.org/documentation#https
moe.secure_connection = true
# (optional)
# set historical date of the rate
# see https://openexchangerates.org/documentation#historical-data
moe.date = '2015-01-01'
# Store in cache
moe.save_rates

Money.default_bank = moe
~~~

You can also provide a Proc as a cache to provide your own caching mechanism
perhaps with Redis or just a thread safe `Hash` (global). For example:

~~~ ruby
moe.cache = Proc.new do |v|
  key = 'money:exchange_rates'
  if v
    Thread.current[key] = v
  else
    Thread.current[key]
  end
end
~~~

## Tests

~~~
bundle exec rake
